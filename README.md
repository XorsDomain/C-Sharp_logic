# Logic  Exercise

This exercise contains basic logic problems for you to solve.

To complete the exercise, provide a working implementation for each method.

### Setup
1. Open the project in your editor
1. Provide solutions to each of the methods in the CSharpLogic class, following the instructions in the comments.

### Testing Your Solutions

A number of unit tests have been written to test the implementation of each method.

To test your solutions:
1. Open the CSharpLogicTests class and right click on the test of the method you are trying to test. For example, the test named 'GetGradeReturnsA' is testing the method getGrade with a value which should return 'A'.
1. A dialog should appear and indicate whether the test passed or failed.
1. To run all of the tests, you can right click on the LogicExerciseTest class and click Run LogicExerciseTest.
